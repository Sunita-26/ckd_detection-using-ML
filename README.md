CKD Prediction Using Machine Learning and Flask
This project implements a predictive model for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using various Machine Learning algorithms. The model is trained on medical data to classify patients as CKD-positive or CKD-negative based on their health metrics. The application is built using Flask, providing a user-friendly web interface for inputting patient data and obtaining predictions in real-time.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing medical datasets for accurate model training.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of multiple ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) to predict CKD.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the models.
Flask Web App: A simple and intuitive web interface to input data and display prediction results.
Deployment: Easy deployment options for local and cloud-based environments.
Technologies:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas & Numpy
Flask
HTML/CSS for front-end
